# Description

Run a Minecraft server via Chef Solo on Amazon EC2 (although this repo
will likely work with other hosts as well).

# Credits

* The [Chef Solo Tutorial by Jo Liss](http://www.opinionatedprogrammer.com/2011/06/chef-solo-tutorial-managing-a-single-server-with-chef/) served as my starting point for this repo
* [Walter Higgins' post](http://walterhiggins.net/blog/posterous-setting-up-a-peaceful-minecraft-multiplayer-s) on setting up a Minecraft server gave me the app-specific basics
